# micropolis-sdl2pp-city-convert
This is a very small utility to convert Micropolis cities and scenarios into the format used by Micropolis-SDL2PP. It uses modified code from Micropolis.

This tool is not intended nor designed to provide a perfect port of Micropolis or SimCity Classic cities. It makes a lot of assumptions and doesn't do much in the way of error correction. Use at your own risk.

## License
This project is licensed under the GPL as required by the original code. See COPYING for details. There are additional licensing stipulations required by EA, see "ADDITIONAL TERMS" in __README_OG.

## TODO
There are a few things I'd like to add to this utility before I really call it complete:

* Add program start message to indicate copyrights as required by the GPL
* Copy graph histories
* Properly parse program arguments
* Offer better error correction/handling where necessary
